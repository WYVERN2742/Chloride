A PvE/PvP fast pace hovercraft shooter heavily inspired by [Sodium One: Salt Shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_(video_game))

Customise your own modular hovering weapons platform and shoot things at high
speed in an arena, with multiple weapon types and different modules for your
craft!

First goal is to have a custom hover craft, and a simple racing game, before
adding weapons/etc

## Controls

Aim is a vr-first design, with a player cockpit at the center of the craft. Use
motion controllers like a tank pilot for an immersive and intuitive movement for
agile dodges, sudden strafes and quick turnarounds! Combat is especially geared
towards movement, since you can’t take damage if you’re never hit!

Weapons are fixed to the craft, so you’ll have to turn around to hit things.
This can get difficult if you’ve managed to lose a rotor!

Keyboard/mouse will also be supported, and hopefully controllers too!

## Make your craft yours

Each craft has three weapons; one special cannon and two main guns. The special
cannon (also; may not actually be a cannon) will act as a “class ability”, with
special effects such as a rail gun, or even a close-range shotgun!

The two smaller weapons are individually selectable and consist of your standard
weapon load out, like mini guns, rocket launchers, etc!

You can also change the configuration of your rotors! Have a single forward fan
for more speed and special weapon stability, or have two for better main weapon
and strafing capability!

Different unlockable fans will also be available, increasing the power of your
craft!

### Extra Customisability

Possible ideas for *after* a few weapons and specials are done

- The ability for changing your livery colours / patterns
- Cockpit decorations (interactive in VR?)
- Special modules! - replaces the large integrated cannon.
	- The ever-classic rocket pod!
	- Third person camera drone!
		- Display as a small screen in the cockpit, allow switching for non-vr?
	- Speed boost!
	- Enhanced Radar!
	- Emp systems!
	- Healing bots!

## Design and Theme

Main idea for theme and design is a junkyard style at the moment. This is an
illegal racing scenario! Parts cobbled together, hydraulics leaking,
rust-covered roll cages and beefy combustion engines are keeping everything
working!

It will be a bit difficult to have somehow managed a salvaged sci-fi feel with
the parts. Exposed pipes / hydraulics along with cables and hover plates / fans?

### Extra Design Plans

- Can leave out the over plates for now and only have fans? ( ~~OnlyFans~~ )
- Better tech is the more futuristic style (cleaner parts, etc)
	- Gives a large amount of room for design expansion
